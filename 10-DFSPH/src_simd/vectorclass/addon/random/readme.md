# Ranvec1

# Random number generator

Ranvec1 is an efficient high quality pseudo random number generator designed for large vector applications and multi-threaded applications.

**Features:**
* Vector and scalar output
* Random integers with uniform distribution in an arbitrary interval
* Random floating point numbers with single and double precision
* Suitable for large Monte Carlo simulations
* Suitable for multi-threaded applications
* High security
* High resolution and very long cycle length
* Includes seed generator based on truly random physical process
* Detailed theoretical description available
